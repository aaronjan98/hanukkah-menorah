# Hanukkah Menorah

- The site is hosted [here](https://hanukkah-menorah.netlify.app/)

- I created all the menorah elements with svgs to make it scalable on all devices
- Future plans of the project
    - is either make it a template for ecards
    - or make it interactive by moving the shamash and lighting the candles
    - I do want to add a curtain of stars in the background to make it look more interesting
